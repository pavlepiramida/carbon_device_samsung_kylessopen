CarbonROM 4.4 device tree for the Samsung Galaxy Ace II X (GT-S7560M)

Only needs legacymod/display-legacy to boot out of the box.
For wifi you need legacymod atheros,
for bt you need to swap bluedroid with bluez,all projects for bluez can be found at KlinkOnE github page.
carbon is very close to CM so reusing all my commits on forked cm project will FIX a lot of 
things that are broken (im to lazy to write and document which commits you need in which project but once you start building youll get the idea of whats missing).
Only thing I want to point out is that in frameworks/native you need commits to disable Vsync on on msm7x27a as it is very heavy on the gpu and cpu.
